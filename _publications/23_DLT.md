## Contribution
A new exciting result on Simon's congruence.
The paper is a result of the visiting research in Canada in Summer 2022.

## Abstract
Given an integer k, Simon’s congruence relation says that two
strings u and v are ~k -congruent if they have the same set of subsequences
of length at most k. We extend Simon’s congruence to languages. First,
we define the Simon’s congruence neighborhood of a language L to be a
set of strings that have a ~k -congruent string in L. Next, we define two
languages L1 and L2 to be ≡k -congruent if both have the same Simon’s
congruence neighborhood. We prove that it is PSPACE-complete to check
≡k -congruence of two regular languages and decidable up to recursive
languages. Moreover, we tackle the problem of computing the maximum k
that makes two given languages ≡k -congruent. This problem is PSPACE-
complete for two regular languages, and undecidable for context-free
languages.
