## Abstract
Two strings are Simon’s ~k-congruent if they have the same set of subsequences of length at most k.
We study the Simon’s congruence closure of a string, which is regular by definition.
Given a string w over an alphabet Σ, we present an efficient DFA construction
that accepts all ~k-congruent strings with respect to w.
We also present lower bounds for the state complexity of the Simon’s congruence closure.
Finally, we design a polynomial-time algorithm that answers the following open problem:
“given a string w over a fixed-sized alphabet, an integer k and a (regular or context-free) language L,
decide whether there exists a string v∈L such that w~kv.”
The problem is NP-complete for a variable-sized alphabet.
