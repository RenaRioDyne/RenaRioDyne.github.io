We investigate the orthogonal range searching problem
in multidimensional settings.
Given n points in a d-dimensional space,
the problem is to preprocess the points
so that we can answer axis-parallel hyperrectangular queries
asking for all points inside the hyperrectangle
in sublinear time.
We study data structures called the kd-tree and the range tree,
and learn how we can use the data structures to solve the orthogonal range searching problem.
