We study the Rate Distortion Theory,
which describes the relation between rate and distortion
in a lossy encoding setting.
Specifically, we focus on proving that
the infimum of all achievable rates
given an input distribution and a target distortion
is equal to the output of the information rate distortion function.
We study algorithms to compute
the information rate distortion function.
