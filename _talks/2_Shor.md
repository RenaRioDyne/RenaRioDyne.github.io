We study Shor's algorithm,
which allows us to factorize numbers in polynomial time
using a quantum computer.
The scheme consists of two parts,
a quantum circuit for computing the order of an element
in a multiplicative group modulo some number,
and a non-quantum probabilistic algorithm
that uses the quantum circuit as a module.
