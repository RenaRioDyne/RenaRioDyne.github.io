I am a theoretical computer scientist enrolled in the M.S./Ph.D. integrated course in Yonsei University. My instructor is professor [Yo-Sub Han](https://toc.yonsei.ac.kr/~emmous/),
who is the head of the [Yonsei ToC lab](https://toc.yonsei.ac.kr/).
Currently, my main research interests are string algorithms (with a focus on Simon's congruence), quantum algorithms and finite state machines.

## Professional
This is my fifth semester in the integrated course.
I am continuing my research on string algorithms and learning more about quantum computing.
From this semester, I lead the Yonsei theory study group with [Changyeol Lee](https://chang-yeol.github.io/). The topics for this semester are TBD.

## Personal
I am an avid fan of video games.
