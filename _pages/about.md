I am a theoretical computer scientist enrolled in the M.S./Ph.D. integrated course in Yonsei University. My instructor is professor [Yo-Sub Han](https://toc.yonsei.ac.kr/~emmous/),
who is the head of the [Yonsei ToC lab](https://toc.yonsei.ac.kr/).
Currently, my main research interests are string algorithms (with a focus on Simon's congruence) and finite state machines.

## Professional
I just finished my third semester in the integrated course.
Through coursework, I learned about online algorithms and NLP systems last semester.
While doing so, I am continuing my research on string algorithms.


## Personal
I am an avid fan of video games.
