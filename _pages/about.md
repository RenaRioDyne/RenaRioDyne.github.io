I am a theoretical computer scientist enrolled in the M.S./Ph.D. integrated course in Yonsei University. My instructor is professor [Yo-Sub Han](https://toc.yonsei.ac.kr/~emmous/),
who is the head of the [Yonsei ToC lab](https://toc.yonsei.ac.kr/).
Currently, my main research interests are pattern matching algorithms (with a focus on Simon's congruence and Cartesian trees) and finite state machines.

## Professional
I am in my fourth year in the integrated course.
I am continuing my research on string algorithms.
I lead the [Yonsei theory student group](https://yonsei-cs-theory-students.github.io/) with [Changyeol Lee](https://chang-yeol.github.io/).

## Personal
I am an avid fan of video games.
